## Development
1. Apollo Software Cinnamon uses [Yarn Berry (3.x)](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for workspace management. You should install it with `yarn set version latest`:
  ```bash
  # To install Yarn 3.x globally:
  npm i -g yarn
  cd ~
  yarn set version latest
  
  # To update the local version:
  cd /path/to/cinnamon/repository
  
  # ...for compatibility reasons, this step is important for yarn 1.
  # ...yarn 1, by default, will not install versions newer than 1.x with "yarn set version latest"
  yarn set version stable
  
  # After running "yarn set version stable", run this to ensure you're on the latest release of
  # yarn berry.
  yarn set version latest
  
  # Afterwards, run yarn --version to confirm everything was installed correctly.
  yarn --version
  # ...should output "3.x.x"
  ```
2. Run `yarn` in the repository root to install the packages and link the workspaces.
3. To build the project, use `yarn build`.
