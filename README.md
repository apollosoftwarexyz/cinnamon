# Cinnamon

## Development
Apollo Software Cinnamon uses [Yarn Berry (2.x)](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for workspace management. You should begin by ensuring you have Yarn Berry installed:
```bash
# Install Yarn if you haven't already got it.
npm install --global yarn
# Assuming you have Yarn 1.x installed, switch to Yarn 2 with:
$ yarn set version berry
# Then update to the latest version of Yarn Berry:
$ yarn set version latest
```
