Cinnamon is a backend web framework inspired by [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) as a frontend counterpart. With Cinnamon, our key aim is to achieve minimal code repetition between projects to allow developers to focus on developing their specific application.

Cinnamon is intended for projects where your backend service is isolated from your frontend such as a mobile or single-page web application - meaning the backend is entirely data and business logic driven.

## Development
1. Apollo Software Cinnamon uses [Yarn Berry (3.x)](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for workspace management. You should install it with `yarn set version latest`:
  ```bash
  # To install Yarn 3.x globally:
  npm i -g yarn
  cd ~
  yarn set version latest
  
  # To update the local version:
  cd /path/to/cinnamon/repository
  yarn set version latest
  ```
2. Run `yarn` in the repository root to install the packages and link the workspaces.
3. Once you're set up, you should run `yarn docs:dev`, to run the documentation site in interactive development mode. The documentation site uses [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) with the content plugin which allows you to update the documentation either by editing the markdown files, or by double-clicking on a documentation page and interactively editing the site.
4. To build the project, use `yarn build`. You can also use `yarn example:start`, to run the example project.
