Cinnamon is a backend web framework inspired by [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) as a frontend counterpart. With Cinnamon, our key aim is to achieve minimal code repetition between projects to allow developers to focus on developing their specific application.

Cinnamon is intended for projects where your backend service is isolated from your frontend such as a mobile or single-page web application - meaning the backend is entirely data and business logic driven.
