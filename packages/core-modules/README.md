# @apollosoftwarexyz/cinnamon-core-modules
This package acts as a 'holder' for Cinnamon's core module class aliases.

This package imports all of Cinnamon's core modules (modules that are activated by default), waits for the default Cinnamon instance to initialize the modules, and re-exports them as appropriately named fields, so they may be used globally.
