This package contains internal utility methods for Cinnamon that are shared between modules for efficiency and better organization.

**This package should not be accessed or used outside of Cinnamon's Core framework or Core Modules.** Its API methods are subject to change at the convenience of the framework and relying on it for external packages will probably cause pain and suffering.
