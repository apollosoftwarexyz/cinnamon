# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

> Presently, Cinnamon is in 'release preparation mode', which means only the master
> branch is the supported version of the software.
> 
> At this time, you should not be using any version of Cinnamon with the impression
> that its API surface is complete, will not be changed, or that parts of the
> framework are guaranteed to meet or will meet requirements in performance or speed.
> 
> The above can be considered outdated (i.e., it can be considered that we *have*, in
> fact, released a version that meets our requirements and expectations in performance
> or speed) when we release a 1.x.x version.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send us an email at [contact@apollosoftware.xyz](mailto:contact@apollosoftware.xyz)
with your vulnerability report. We will aim to respond within 1 working day with our
response to your vulnerability report (which will be one of `rejected`, `needs internal
review`, `further information required`, or `accepted`). In extreme cases, please allow
us up to 30 days to review your report - which is what we would consider the responsible
disclosure period.

If the vulnerability is accepted or requires review, we will keep in touch with you
regarding the status and/or details of the fix (except where security or other unforseen
reasons prevent us from doing so - at which point we will inform you as such.)

If we reply indicating that the status is `further information required`, we were either
unable to understand your report, or further information was needed to understand what
the issue was, or how to fix it.

Otherwise, we will inform you that the report has been rejected, at which point you
are free to publicly report the vulnerability on this repository.
